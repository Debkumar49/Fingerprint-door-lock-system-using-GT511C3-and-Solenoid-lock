Fingerprint door lock system using GT511C3 Fingerprint Sensor  and Solenoid lock

Security has been playing a key role in many of our places like offices, institutions, libraries, 
laboratories etc. in order to keep our data confidentially so that no other unauthorized person 
could have an access on them. 

Nowadays, at every point of time, we need security systems for protection of valuable data 
and even money. This paper presents a fingerprint based door opening system which 
provides security which can be used for many banks, institutes and various organizations 
etc..,. There are other methods of verifying authentication through password, RFID but this 
method is most efficient and reliable. To provide perfect security to the bank lockers and to 
make the work easier, this project is taking help of two different technologies viz. 
EMBEDDED SYSTEMS and BIOMETRICS. Unauthorized access is prohibited by 
designing a lock that stores the fingerprints of one or more authorized users. Fingerprint is 
sensed by sensor and is validated for authentication. If the fingerprint matches, the door will 
be opened automatically otherwise it will remain locked.
